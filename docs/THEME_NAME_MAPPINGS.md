## Translation System

### How It Works

1. **Backend Generation:** The server generates routines with LOTR-themed names
2. **Frontend Translation:** JavaScript automatically translates names based on active theme
3. **Real-time Switching:** Toggle themes to see names instantly transform
4. **Fallback System:** Any unmapped names are auto-converted (uppercase + symbol replacement)

### Naming Patterns

**LOTR Theme:**
- Medieval fantasy terminology
- References to places, characters, and items from Middle-earth
- Poetic and descriptive language
- Symbols: ⚔ 🌊 ⛰ 🛡 🎯 ◈

**Terminator Theme:**
- Military/tactical terminology
- System and protocol language
- Technical and mission-focused
- ALL CAPS FORMATTING
- Symbols: ◉ ▣ ▲ ▼ ≈ ▬
